I'd like to present a standalone command line vanity FakeCoin address generator
called FAKu.

FAKu is fast.  FAKu is also user-friendly in that it provides feedback on its
rate of progress and how many keys it has checked.

FAKu is written in C, and is provided in source code form and
pre-built Win32 binaries.  At present, FAKu can be built on Linux,
and requires the openssl and pcre libraries.

FAKu can generate regular FakeCoin addresses as well as other coin addresses
but why the hell would you want to mess with other coins when FAK is the best?

FAKu can search for exact prefixes or regular expression matches.
When searching for exact prefixes, FAKu will ensure that the
prefix is possible, will provide a difficulty estimate, and will run
about 30% faster.  Exact prefixes are case-sensitive by default, but
may be searched case-insensitively using the "-i" option.  Regular
expression patterns follow the Perl-compatible regular expression
language.

FAKu can accept a list of patterns to search for, either on the
command line, or from a file or stdin using the "-f" option.  File
sources should have one pattern per line.  When searching for N exact
prefixes, performance of O(logN) can be expected, and extremely long
lists of prefixes will have little effect on search rate.  Searching
for N regular expressions will have varied performance depending on the
complexity of the expressions, but O(N) performance can be expected.

By default, FAKu will spawn one worker thread for each CPU in your
system.  If you wish to limit the number of worker threads created by
FAKu, use the "-t" option.

The example below is totaly fake, unlike FAK, but gives you an idea of what
a typical output looks like:

$ ./FAKu tNiteAttack
Difficulty: 4476342
[48165 K/s][total 2080000][Prob 37.2%][50% in 21.2s]
Pattern: tNiteAttack
Address: tNiteAttackCDLUZh6Q8ixv74M5YGVxXaN
Privkey: 5JLUmjZiirgziDmWmNprPsNx8DYwfakUNk1FQXmDPaoKB36fX1o

Currently, to import the private key into FakeCoin you would need to use
the command "importprivkey" that accepts the base-58 encoded private key FAKu
generates. So open the console by clicking on HELP>>DEBUG WINDOW and then click
on the CONSOLE tab. Then its just a simple case of entering the command. To
use the above example you would enter:

importprivkey 5JLUmjZiirgziDmWmNprPsNx8DYwfakUNk1FQXmDPaoKB36fX1o

If you dont see your new vanity address in the receive list, restart your
client. Alright that's all, go die in a fire.
